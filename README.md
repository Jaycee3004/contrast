contrast
========

contrast is a Python implementation of the STUCCO algorithm ([URL][1]) that 
allows the ability to learn association rules that exhibit significant 
enrichment in one group over another. As a result, the produced association 
rules can help "describe" indicators aligned to a group of interest.

Dependencies
------------
- Python 3.7+
- numpy (1.15+)
- pandas (0.23+)

Such libraries can also be installed using the [Anaconda Python installer][2].
